## Hello!

Most of the code I wrote in recent years does not belong to me, therefore many repositories here are either old or fun side projects.

If you are in the business of figuring out whether I can code, some relevant repositories are:
- [XCIR](https://github.com/SRenan/XCIR). An **R package** (and part of my PhD thesis) for the inference of escape from X-Chromosome Inactivation using bulk RNA-seq data.
- [PICS](https://github.com/SRenan/PICS) and [PING](https://github.com/SRenan/PING) for examples of (now deprecated) BioConductor packages I wrote.
- [CPPICS](https://github.com/SRenan/CPPICS). A port of PICS I used to teach myself **C++** (and Rcpp in the process).
- [discord](https://github.com/SRenan/discord). A discord bot hosted on a Raspberry PI. (Because I can still write in **python** despite using R for most of my career!)
